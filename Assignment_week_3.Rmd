## Growth of Orange Trees
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(plotly)
library(GGally)
data(Orange)
```
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpairs(data=Orange, aes(colour=Tree), columns=2:3) %>% ggplotly()
```

## Conclusions

On previous figure we saw high correlation between orange trees' 
age and circumference. Further steps may be fitting a linear model to predict 
orange tree's age based on its circumference.

Thank you for attention :)
